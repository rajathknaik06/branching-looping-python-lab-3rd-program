""" Ethan, a curious mathematician, is fascinated by perfect numbers. A perfect number is a number that equals the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). Ethan wants to identify all perfect numbers within a given range. 



Help him write a program to list these numbers.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer start, representing the starting number of the range.

The second line consists of an integer end, representing the ending number of the range.

Output format :
The output prints all perfect numbers in the range, separated by a space.
